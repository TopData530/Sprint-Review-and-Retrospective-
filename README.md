# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective-

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
### By determining exactly what features or products users want to have, and then taking those suggestions to the devlopment team for devloping and testing. Creating "user stories" allows us to break down each feature being added with the details and adding functionality.
## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
### To devlop the products, we need a clear idea of the functions that are being requested in the programming, such as menu options and display of features. The agile process I hope to incorporate into my future devlopments are continuous improvements and daily sprints to check on progress and problem solve.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
### To be a good team member, having communication is the most important part of a team. The other attributes to be a good team member is honesty, transparency, and be a great problem-solver.
